                    <p class="gist">Hello again,</p>

                    <p class="gist">This is the second issue of <em><a href="/thegistof" class="gist">the gist of</a></em> written by <a href="https://berveno.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank" class="gist">Misha Berveno</a>. If you no longer wish to receive these letters, you can instantly unsubscribe — no hard feelings at all.

                    <p class="gist">After a brief overview of verbal identity in the <a href="/thegistof/s1e1-verbal-identity" class="gist">previous issue</a>, today we’re diving into the first verbal identity element — naming.</p>

                    <p class="gist">It seems like naming shouldn’t be included in verbal identity — it’s just what you call a company or product (or service). But it’s crucial. A good name can express the full meaning of a brand on its own (e.g. 1Password) or carry the meaning infused into it (e.g. BMW ➙ high-quality German manufacturing).</p>

                    <p class="gist">So how should we think about naming? What are some dos and don’ts? And why is naming important?</p>

                    <p class="gist">Let’s find out,</p>

                    <h2 class="gist letter">What’s in a name?</h2>
                    
                    <p class="gist">A name is the first thing people want to know about when you introduce them to your new company or product.</p>

                    <p class="gist"><em>What’s it called? What’s the URL? How do I find it?</em></p>

                    <p class="gist">If something doesn’t have a name, it’s a little disappointing. It’s almost like we can’t wrap our heads around a nameless concept.</p>
                    
                    <p class="gist">We need clarity. That’s why we need a name.</p>

                    <h2 class="gist letter">Why is naming important?</h2>

                    <p class="gist">There are two overarching reasons that make naming a crucial process in creating a verbal identity:</p>

                    <ol class="gist">
                        <li class="gist">A name is the most shareable brand unit for spreading your message</li>
                        <li class="gist">A name acts as the epicentre of your brand and allows it to grow outward</li>
                    </ol>   

                    <blockquote>
                        <p class="gist"><em>“To evoke a proper image there must be a name created which the customer will be able to relate to. … A name needs to sell a concept in a public’s mind.”</em></p>

                    </blockquote>

                    <h2 class="gist letter">A name vs. a personal brand</h2>

                    <p class="gist">If you’re mostly working by yourself (as I do), you might wonder why not just invest in your own name — creating a personal brand?</p>

                    <p class="gist">In my own case, why differentiate between <a href="https://berveno.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank" class="gist">Misha Berveno</a>, the writer, and <a href="/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" class="gist">No Country Studio</a>, the copywriting studio?

                    <p class="gist">A personal brand is by far the best tool for building <a href="https://nav.al/accountability-equity" rel="noopener" target="_blank" class="gist">accountability</a>. You sign the work. You own the failures. You reap the rewards.</p>

                    <p class="gist">There are two potential downsides:</p>

                    <ol class="gist">
                        <li class="gist">Being limited in scope. The best personal brands are one-dimensional, in the sense that we know them for excelling at one thing. <a href="https://bloomberg.com/opinion/authors/ARbTQlRLRjE/matthew-s-levine" rel="noopener" target="_blank" class="gist">Matt Levine</a> writes Money Stuff (<em>note: highly recommended</em>). <a href="https://jessicahische.is" rel="noopener" target="_blank" class="gist">Jessica Hische</a> is a lettering artist.</li>
                        <li class="gist">Being limited in scale. When you present your work under a personal brand, people will often assume you do it all yourself. If there’s a team behind your name, you have to be very clear and transparent to maintain trust. Companies, on the other hand, are treated as teams by default.</li>
                    </ol>   

                    <p class="gist">That said, some of the most famous companies are named after their founders, from Adidas to Deloitte to Nordstrom.</p>

                    <p class="gist">At the same time, there are companies that intentionally limit themselves in scope, in the sense of excelling at one thing. <a href="https://hiutdenim.co.uk" rel="noopener" target="_blank" class="gist">Hiut Denim</a> makes jeans. <a href="https://culturedcode.com/things" rel="noopener" target="_blank" class="gist">Cultured Code</a> makes Things.</p>

                    <p class="gist">Sometimes you also come across successful combinations of a personal brand with extended scope and scale.</p>

                    <p class="gist"><a href="https://vanschneider.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank" class="gist">Tobias van Schneider</a> runs the House of Van Schneider, which creates awesome products like <a href="https://semplice.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank" class="gist">Semplice</a> and <a href="https://mymind.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank" class="gist">mymind</a>.</p>

                    <h2 class="gist letter">How to think about naming</h2>

                    <p class="gist">Naming agencies experiment with dozens of techniques before settling on their own process through trial and error.</p>

                    <p class="gist">Here are a few frequently used naming strategies:</p>

                    <ul class="gist">
                        <li class="gist"><strong>Descriptive</strong>. Alludes to functionality (e.g. Dropbox, PlayStation).</li>
                        
                        <li class="gist"><strong>Eponym</strong>. Named after founders (e.g. Walmart, Toyota). Used to be one of the most popular naming techniques, but its current adoption among startups is quite low.</li>
                        
                        <li class="gist"><strong>Portmanteau</strong>. A combination of two or more existing words that roughly describe the product or service (e.g. Pinterest, Microsoft). Unlike descriptive names, portmanteaus only use partial words.</li>
                        
                        <li class="gist"><strong>Neologism</strong>. Coined names (e.g. Etsy, Xerox).</li>

                        <li class="gist"><strong>Evocative</strong>. Uses words to describe a feeling or emotion, often related to the product’s benefits (e.g. <a href="/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" class="gist">No Country Studio</a>, <a href="https://nomorefiction.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank" class="gist">No More Fiction</a>).</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="gist">So what’s the best name for your product or service? It’s likely there isn’t one, but good names strive to attain some common qualities:</p>

                    <ul class="gist">
                        <li class="gist"><strong>Balance</strong>. Being easy to spell and pronounce.</li>
                        
                        <li class="gist"><strong>Appeal</strong>. Speaking directly to their target audience.</li>
                        
                        <li class="gist"><strong>Differentiation</strong>. Standing out in the marketplace.</li>
                        
                        <li class="gist"><strong>Promise</strong>. Implying intended benefits.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="gist">How do you put it all together? Eli Altman in his book <a href="https://nopicnicpress.com/shop/dont-call-it-that" rel="noopener" target="_blank" class="gist"><em>Don’t Call It That</em></a> lays out a number of good approaches you can start with:</p>

                    <ul class="gist">
                        <li class="gist">Write the idea behind your brand in a single sentence. Come up with lots of bad names, re-evaluate and improve.</li>
                        
                        <li class="gist">Look at your competitors. Think of names that would stand out next to them.</li>
                        
                        <li class="gist">Explore metaphors. What kind of concepts would help people see what you do in a new light?</li>
                        
                        <li class="gist">Scan fiction, poetry and even Wikipedia. Highlight interesting phrases and uses of language.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="gist"><em>Note: Focus on how potential names feel when spoken aloud. What sounds intriguing? What invites a conversation?</em></p>

                    <h2 class="gist letter">What not to do when it comes to naming</h2>

                    <p class="gist">In coming up with names, try not to be too literal. Most descriptive names are hard to remember and even harder to trademark. Top-Shelf Wines is not a good name for a winery or liquor store.</p>

                    <p class="gist">Similarly, avoid changing the standard spelling of the words just to get a .com URL. It’ll be confusing forever. With so many new top-level domains available, you can surely find an alternative.</p>

                    <p class="gist">Also, don’t commit to a name without doing at least a little bit of research first:</p>

                    <ul class="gist">
                        <li class="gist">Search for similar names within your industry</li>
                        
                        <li class="gist">Use cultural brand screening to avoid overly negative connotations</li>
                        
                        <li class="gist">Consult an IP attorney for any common-law conflicts and trademarking opportunities</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="gist">Some countries don’t require you to trademark your business name and still give you the first-use advantage. However, it’s usually limited to your province or state. Trademarking might be important if you want to expand federally or internationally.</p>

                    <p class="gist"><em>Note: For more info regarding international trademark registration, read about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_system" rel="noopener" target="_blank" class="gist">Madrid system</a>.</em></p>

                    <h2 class="gist letter">SkateBoss: A case study</h2>

                    <p class="gist">In 2016, I was working at <a href="https://skyrocket.is" rel="noopener" target="_blank" class="gist">Skyrocket</a>, a digital branding agency, and one of our clients needed a title for <a href="https://behance.net/gallery/43644295/SkateBoss-Naming-Brand-Identity" rel="noopener" target="_blank" class="gist">a new game</a> targeting kids aged 8-12.</p>

                    <p class="gist">It was a business simulator, giving kids an opportunity to develop entrepreneurial skills by running a virtual skateboard shop.</p>

                    <p class="gist">What were the titles of skateboarding games at the time?</p>

                    <ul class="gist">
                        <li class="gist">Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater</li>
                        
                        <li class="gist">Skate</li>
                        
                        <li class="gist">Skate City</li>

                        <li class="gist">Skater XL</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="gist">Incorporating “skate” into the name seemed essential. To attract the target audience, a game like this needed to be somewhat descriptive, since there wasn’t much time or budget to infuse meaning into a new concept (it’s no Halo or Far Cry).</p>

                    <p class="gist">At the same time, the name had to differentiate between doing tricks and being an entrepreneur.</p>

                    <p class="gist">Finally, for the game to spread through word of mouth, the title needed to be something the kids would actually talk about. So:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p class="gist"><em>Hey, you played <a href="https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2016/11/22/1069513/0/en/content4good-Launches-SkateBoss-Demo-to-Help-Kids-Learn-Social-Entrepreneurship-through-Gaming.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank" class="gist">SkateBoss</a> yet?</em></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p class="gist">In the end, naming is a creative exercise, but there are no barriers to entry. Be playful, think metaphorically, try to relate to your audience and do some research. That’s all there’s to it.</p>

                    <p class="gist">Even if you screw it up somehow — thousands of companies and products have changed their names in the past and are doing just fine. Don’t let indecisiveness stall your progress.</p>

                    <p class="gist">The next letter will be about the importance of vision and mission.</p>
